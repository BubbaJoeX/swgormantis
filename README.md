# Mantis Bugtracker Dark Theme

## About

I wanted a dark theme for MantisBT. While it's not enough to just add a `default.css` into the `config_inc.php` variable *$g_css_include_file*, I tried to write a plugin, which replaces the needed CSS classes. Maybe there are still some ugly colors or things - I'm no pro here. (-;

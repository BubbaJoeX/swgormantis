# Mantis Bugtracker Dark Theme

## About

I wanted a dark theme for MantisBT. While it's not enough to just add a `default.css` into the `config_inc.php` variable `$g_css_include_file`, I tried to write a plugin, which hopefully will replace the needed CSS classes soon. So: plugin is still in development (still learning how to write MantisBT plugins properly).
